                <td>The Chevrolet Impala (fourth generation) are full-size automobiles produced by Chevrolet for the 1965 through 1970 model years.<br> The 1965 Impala was all new, while the 1967 and 1969 models featured new bodies on the same redesigned perimeter frame introduced on the 1965 models.<br> All Impalas of this generation received annual facelifts as well, distinguishing each model year. Throughout the early 1960s, Chevrolet's basic body designs<br> became increasingly subtle, while the bright trim that was part of the Impala package added more than a touch of luxury to the look. The same pattern was<br> followed in the interiors, where the best materials and equipment Chevrolet had to offer were displayed. In short, the Impala was on its way to becoming a<br> kind of junior-grade Cadillac, which, for both the company and its customers, was just fine.</td>
